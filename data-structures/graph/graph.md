## Graph

a graph is an abstract data type that is ment to implement the undirected graph and directed graphconcepts from mathematics, specifically the fieldof graph theory.

a graph data structure consists of a finite (and possible mutable) set of nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs for a undirected graph or a set of order pairs for directed graph. These pairs are known as edgesdirected lines for a directed graph. the nodes may be part of the graph structure , or may be external entities represented by integers indices or references.
